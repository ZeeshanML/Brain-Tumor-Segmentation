# AI Notebooks - Tutorial - Brain tumor segmentation using U-Net

## Objective

Over the past few years, the field of **computer vision** has experienced a significant growth. It encompasses a wide range of methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images.

Among these methods, one is called **image segmentation**.

The purpose of this tutorial is to show you how it is possible to build and train a brain tumor segmentation model with **OVHcloud AI Notebooks**. You will be able to learn the concepts of medical imaging, image segmentation, model evaluation, and much more. We will use a popular convolutional neural network named **U-Net**.

At the end of this tutorial, you will have learnt the principal methods to **segment brain tumors**.
